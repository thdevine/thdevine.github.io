This is all information for my personal website. All user-specific content not identifiable by block text is related to my GitHub username (thdevine) or image files (here, .png, .pdf) files. 

To create your own website from mine: 1. copy my repo by downloading the zip file (note, you cannot upload the folders so you'd have to fork my repo and create identical branches, but I'm continuing on as if you don't know how to do that), 2. change the html code to desired format, 3. then upload to your own "YOURNAME.github.io" repo. You'll have to create your own folder since you can't upload them. To do that, you create a file and when you name it just have "FOLDERNAME/file.txt", then just upload all the files in that folder directly to that folder. 

Of course, there are adjustments for photos and pdfs that you must accommodate for on-the-go.

<!-- ## Packages -->

<!-- - [TimeSeriesCatchAll](https://github.com/ryanbieber/Time-Series-Catch-All) A time-series package that runs 1000s of models against your series in parallel. It uses Hyndman's [Forecast](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/), [Forecasthybrid](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecastHybrid/forecastHybrid.pdf), and the package [DLM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlm/dlm.pdf) to forecast a time-series. It is in a state where I am happy with it, it is able to go through thousands of models in parallel for a time series and based off the steps forward you want to look it is able to do the backtesting and pick the best model forward. -->

<!-- ## Apps -->

<!-- - [Caloric Expenditure](https://ryanbieber.shinyapps.io/BMR_Calc/) This shiny app will calculate how long it will take you to lose/gain weight based on your current caloric deficit/surplus and activity. It also takes into account how lean you are, among other factors, to give you a [Basal Metabolic Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate).  -->

<!-- - [Distance to Fazoils](https://ryanbieber.shinyapps.io/Distance_to_Fazolis/) This shiny instance was more of a joke between my friends and I about how I use Fazoils as the origin to my cartesian coordinate system. For those of you unaware, Fazoils is a fast food italian place that serves pretty decent italian food. -->

<!-- - [Social Distancing Example](https://ryanbieber.shinyapps.io/sir-model/) This shiny app was based on the SIR model to look at how social distancing works in a simple example and also how epidemics work in this classical example. -->

## Currently in progress adding these to this page.

- [Comedy Recommendation] The whole point of this project was to look at how patches impacted gold prices in world of warcraft. It evolved into trying to predict when to *buy gold* in the mmo to try and play the market just like in the stock market. It turns out that gold prices are very unpredictable and follow a more or less stochastic trend. (One of my first projects)

<!-- - [Twitter NLP](https://github.com/ryanbieber/NLP) This was brought about by being interested in seeing if we could predict the stock market based on twitter sentiment. using [sentimentr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sentimentr/sentimentr.pdf) we are able to determine the sentiment of string of texts. Using this, we are able to get a time-series of someones sentiment. Long story short, it didn't work out as I wanted it to but, it is pretty cool to see someones sentiment over time using their twitter data. -->

<!-- - [Deploying plumber in the IBM Cloud](https://github.com/ryanbieber/deploying-plumber-ibm-cloud) This was more of a learning experience with understanding how a full-stack web application works with R. Also, connecting to a DB2 from a container is somewhat annoying if you have to use that dbms. -->

<!-- - [Modelling application template](https://github.com/ryanbieber/Example-Docker-Repo) Here is a repo that you can clone or fork and use it as a base for a modeling application. The dockerfile is already built and it is a plug and play solution as well as cloud agnostic. -->

<!-- - [Cloud Deployment Modelling Orchestration](https://github.com/ryanbieber/model-deployment-kubernetes) I wanted to have the ability to work in whatever language I wanted so I created a sort of container orchestration template that has 3 separate containers that can run whatever images I want them to. These images can then push their data to a volume which is mounted on each container. This allows for maximum flexibility for using the best language for each job. -->

<!-- ## Packages -->

<!-- - [TimeSeriesCatchAll](https://github.com/ryanbieber/Time-Series-Catch-All) A time-series package that runs 1000s of models against your series in parallel. It uses Hyndman's [Forecast](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/), [Forecasthybrid](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecastHybrid/forecastHybrid.pdf), and the package [DLM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlm/dlm.pdf) to forecast a time-series. It is in a state where I am happy with it, it is able to go through thousands of models in parallel for a time series and based off the steps forward you want to look it is able to do the backtesting and pick the best model forward. -->

<!-- ## Apps -->

<!-- - [Caloric Expenditure](https://ryanbieber.shinyapps.io/BMR_Calc/) This shiny app will calculate how long it will take you to lose/gain weight based on your current caloric deficit/surplus and activity. It also takes into account how lean you are, among other factors, to give you a [Basal Metabolic Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate).  -->

<!-- - [Distance to Fazoils](https://ryanbieber.shinyapps.io/Distance_to_Fazolis/) This shiny instance was more of a joke between my friends and I about how I use Fazoils as the origin to my cartesian coordinate system. For those of you unaware, Fazoils is a fast food italian place that serves pretty decent italian food. -->

<!-- - [Social Distancing Example](https://ryanbieber.shinyapps.io/sir-model/) This shiny app was based on the SIR model to look at how social distancing works in a simple example and also how epidemics work in this classical example. -->
